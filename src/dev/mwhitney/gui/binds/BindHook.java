/**
 * A listener or hook that acts as a middle-man between a component and the usual
 * keyboard and mouse listeners. This allows it to indicate when an input
 * matches a {@link Bind} configured for a {@link Shortcut}.
 * <p>
 * Every BindHook implements functionality from {@link KeyListener},
 * {@link MouseListener}, {@link MouseWheelListener}, and
 * {@link MouseMotionListener}. This allows it to fill in as any of those
 * listeners, capturing, converting, and then comparing events against the
 * application's {@link Bind} configuration for each {@link Shortcut}.
 * <p>
 * The user loses very little by using this class instead of a regular listener.
 * It offers multiple methods which mimic the usual listener behavior and are
 * called after the bind logic executes. For example, if you wanted to use
 * {@link #keyPressed(KeyEvent)}, you would instead override
 * {@link #onKey(KeyInput)}.
 * <p>
 * A few methods from {@link MouseMotionListener} are simply passed on and can
 * be overridden as usual, though it's not required.
